# Topic modeling
There are three notebooks for the three steps of the analysis.

* Data preparation: to perform some initial analysis of the text sources, some cleaning and first view of the common words.
* Initial topic analysis: to explore manually the different topic models and to compare results. Some html files are generated.
* Further analysis: to find the optimal model and to analyze the assigned topics per sample.

# Deliveries
Each explored model has an html file where the user can play with the lambda parameter and find the right balance in the weights to give a meaning.
